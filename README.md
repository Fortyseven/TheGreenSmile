# The Green Smile

One-click popup extension to access popular ASCII/Unicode faces from your Google Chrome browser to your clipboard.

There are other extensions in the Chrome web store that perform the same function... _but none has a name so irrelevant!_

Jokes aside, why did I write this? I have vague trust issues with the other extensions in the store. They don't seem to be updated very often. And, frankly, I just thought it would be a fun little diversion. I wanted an implementation of this kind of extension to be available with full source code available to anyone, free of any kind of 'hanky panky', like ads or worse.

About the name... I'm sorry. _(Not sorry!)_
